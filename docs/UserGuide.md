## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Viewing help : `help`

![help message](images/screenshots/help.png)

Format: `help`


### Adding a member: `add`

Adds a member to the member list.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER g/GENDER d/DATE_OF_BIRTH m/MEMBERSHIP_TYPE e/EMAIL ec/EMERGENCY_CONTACT`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Membership types only include "Monthly" or "Annual"
</box>

* Each **phone number** and **email** must be unique in the member list (no two members may share the same phone or the same email).
* **Names** do not need to be unique; different members are allowed to have the same name as long as their phone and email differ.
* If you try to add someone whose phone or email matches an existing member, the command is rejected and the error message indicates which field is duplicated.

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 g/M d/19-01-2004 m/annual e/johnd@example.com ec/98723347`

* Edits the member at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed member list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* After editing, the member’s **phone** and **email** must still be unique among all other members (same rules as `add`). **Names** may match another member’s name.

Examples:

### Locating members by keyword: `find`

Finds members whose fields contain the search query as a substring.

Format: `find QUERY`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* Only some text-based fields are searched: name, phone, email, emergency contact, membership type.
* Can take any input as the query, including special characters and spaces.
* The entire query is matched as a literal substring against each field.
  e.g. `find john doe` will only return members whose field contains `"john doe"`, not members with just `john` or just `doe`

Examples:
* `find John` returns members with `John` in any field
* `find john doe` returns members whose name (or other field) contains `"john doe"`<br>
  ![result for 'find john doe'](images/screenshots/findResult.png)
* `find 9123` returns members whose phone number or other field contains `9123`
* `find annual` returns members with `annual` membership type

### Filtering members by fields: `filter`

Format: `filter [s/STATUS] [g/GENDER] [m/MEMBERSHIP_TYPE] [age>/AGE] [age</AGE] [age=/AGE] [j>/DATE] [j</DATE] [exp>/DATE] [exp</DATE] [exp=/DATE]`

* `MEMBERSHIP_TYPE` is an optional field.
* The new expiry extends from the **current** expiry date: **annual** adds one year, **monthly** adds one month (from that date, not from today).
* If the membership has **already expired** (expiry date before today), `renew` is rejected; register the person again with `add`.
* Membership type will be updated if included in the command.

Examples:
* `renew 2` renews membership of the 2nd member in the list to `11-04-2026`

### Saving the data

FitDesk data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

FitDesk data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, FitDesk will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause FitDesk to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
