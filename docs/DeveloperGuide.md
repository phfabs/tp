## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the app.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside components being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `CommandHistory` (in `logic/commands/CommandHistory.java`) and the `Command` base class. Each undoable command stores the data needed to reverse or reapply itself, and implements `undo(Model)` and `redo(Model)` methods.

`CommandHistory` maintains two stacks:
* **Undo stack** — bounded `Deque<Command>` of capacity 20, holding commands that can be undone.
* **Redo stack** — `Deque<Command>`, holding commands that were undone and can be redone.

The following operations are the key interactions:
* `CommandHistory#push(command)` — Adds a command to the undo stack and clears the redo stack (a new action invalidates redo history).
* `CommandHistory#pushToUndo(command)` — Adds a command back to the undo stack without clearing the redo stack (used by `RedoCommand`).
* `CommandHistory#pushRedo(command)` — Moves a command to the redo stack after it is undone.
* `CommandHistory#popRedo()` — Retrieves the most recently undone command for redoing.

Given below is an example usage scenario:

Step 1. The user executes `delete 5`. `LogicManager` calls `commandHistory.push(deleteCommand)`, adding it to the undo stack. Redo stack is cleared.

Step 2. The user executes `undo`. `UndoCommand` calls `deleteCommand.undo(model)` to restore the deleted person, then moves `deleteCommand` from the undo stack to the redo stack via `commandHistory.pushRedo(deleteCommand)`.

Step 3. The user executes `redo`. `RedoCommand` calls `commandHistory.popRedo()` to retrieve `deleteCommand`, then calls `deleteCommand.redo(model)` to re-delete the person, and pushes it back to the undo stack via `commandHistory.pushToUndo(deleteCommand)`.

Step 4. The user executes a new undoable command (e.g. `add`). `commandHistory.push(addCommand)` adds it to the undo stack and **clears the redo stack**, as it no longer makes sense to redo the previous delete.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the undo stack is empty, `undo` returns an error. If the redo stack is empty, `redo` returns an error.

</box>

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component when `undo` is executed (assuming `delete 1` was the previous command):

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Undo Sequence Diagram" />

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component when `redo` is executed (after the `undo` above):

<puml src="diagrams/RedoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Redo Sequence Diagram" />

Each undoable command stores the minimal state needed to reverse and reapply itself:

| Command | Data stored | `undo()` | `redo()` |
|---------|-------------|----------|----------|
| `add` | `addedPerson` | `model.deletePerson(addedPerson)` | `model.addPerson(addedPerson)` |
| `edit` | `originalPerson`, `editedPerson` | `model.setPerson(editedPerson, originalPerson)` | `model.setPerson(originalPerson, editedPerson)` |
| `delete` | `deletedPerson`, `previousAddressBook` | `model.setAddressBook(previousAddressBook)` | `model.deletePerson(deletedPerson)` |
| `clear` | `previousAddressBook` | `model.setAddressBook(previousAddressBook)` | `model.setAddressBook(new AddressBook())` |
| `renew` | `originalPerson`, `renewedPerson` | `model.setPerson(renewedPerson, originalPerson)` | `model.setPerson(originalPerson, renewedPerson)` |
| `remark` | `originalPerson`, `editedPerson` | `model.setPerson(editedPerson, originalPerson)` | `model.setPerson(originalPerson, editedPerson)` |

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1:** Saves the entire address book for every command.
  * Pros: Easy to implement uniformly.
  * Cons: High memory usage; saving the full state for every command is wasteful.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Each command stores only the data it needs to undo/redo itself.
  * Pros: Memory-efficient; each command only saves what changed.
  * Cons: Each command must correctly implement `undo()` and `redo()`.

**Aspect: Granularity of undo history:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Every state-modifying command is individually undoable.
  * Pros: Fine-grained control; users can undo exactly one step at a time.
  * Cons: Requires many undo steps to reverse a sequence of bulk changes.

* **Alternative 2:** Group related commands into a single undoable transaction (e.g. a bulk-import).
  * Pros: More intuitive for batch operations.
  * Cons: More complex to implement; requires defining transaction boundaries.


### Tab completion feature

#### Implementation

Tab completion is implemented across three classes:

* `TabCompleter` (`logic/`) — pure logic class that computes completion candidates from the current input string
* `CommandBox` (`ui/`) — handles the `Tab` key press and cycles through candidates
* `MainWindow` (`ui/`) — provides the current filtered list size to `TabCompleter` via an `IntSupplier`

**`TabCompleter`** determines completions based on context, checked in this order:

1. **Value completion** — if the cursor is immediately after a known prefix (`g/`, `m/`, `s/`) with no space after it, suggests valid values (e.g. `filter s/v` → `filter s/valid`)
2. **Command word completion** — if no space has been typed yet, matches partial command words against all known commands
3. **Index-only commands** (`delete`, `details`) — suggests indices 1 to the current filtered list size; no further completion after the index
4. **Index-then-prefix commands** (`edit`, `remark`, `renew`) — suggests indices first, then field prefixes once the index and a space are present
5. **`add`** — suppresses completion until a space follows the first word (the name), then suggests unused field prefixes
6. **`filter`** — suggests field prefixes immediately after the command word

**`CommandBox`** uses `addEventFilter` on the `TextField` to intercept `Tab` before JavaFX's focus traversal system. On each `Tab` press:
* If no candidates exist, computes a fresh candidate list via `TabCompleter`, filtering out any candidate identical to the current text, and selects the first
* Otherwise, advances the index and applies the next candidate (cycling back to the first after the last)
* Any non-`Tab` key press resets the candidate list

<box type="info" seamless>

**Why `addEventFilter` instead of `setOnKeyPressed`?** JavaFX handles `Tab` focus traversal via an event *filter* registered on the scene, which fires before event handlers. Using `addEventFilter` on the `TextField` intercepts `Tab` earlier in the dispatch chain, preventing focus from leaving the field.

</box>

**`MainWindow`** passes `() -> logic.getFilteredPersonList().size()` as an `IntSupplier` to `CommandBox`, which forwards it to `TabCompleter`. This allows index completions to dynamically reflect the current filtered list size without coupling `TabCompleter` directly to the `Logic` or `Model` layers.

The following sequence diagram illustrates a `Tab` press when the user has typed `filter `:

</box>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

1. Shutting down via the `exit` command

   1. Type `exit` in the command box and press Enter.

      Expected: The application closes. Window size and position are saved and will be restored on next launch.

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

1. Deleting a person after filtering the list

   1. Prerequisites: Use the `filter` command (e.g. `filter s/active`) to show a subset of members. At least one member in the filtered list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First member in the *filtered* list is deleted. The filtered view is refreshed. Details of the deleted member shown in the status message.

   1. Test case: `list` followed by `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: Deletes the first member in the full unfiltered list.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with a missing data file

   1. Delete the `data/fitdesk.json` file (or move it elsewhere).

   1. Launch the application.<br>
      Expected: FitDesk starts with a fresh set of sample members. A new `data/fitdesk.json` file is created automatically on the next data-modifying command.

1. Dealing with a corrupted data file

   1. Open `data/fitdesk.json` in a text editor and introduce invalid JSON (e.g. delete a closing brace `}` or set a field to an invalid value such as `"gender": "X"`).

   1. Launch the application.<br>
      Expected: FitDesk starts with an empty member list (no sample data). A warning may be logged. The corrupted file is not overwritten until a data-modifying command is executed.

1. Dealing with missing/incorrect preference file

   1. Delete or corrupt the `preferences.json` file.

   1. Launch the application.<br>
      Expected: FitDesk starts with default window size and position. A new `preferences.json` is created with default values.
